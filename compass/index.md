**Thesis:** High-quality code has never been more important than in the AI era.

**First,** healthy code is more AI-friendly: it is easier for coding agents to analyze, modify, and extend without introducing unintended side effects.

**Second,** as the volume of code grows, human readability becomes increasingly critical. The future will be *hybrid*, and humans will continue to read, review, and reason about code -- precisely when it matters most.

CodeHealth acts as a compass for both humans and coding agents, helping ensure that code remains maintainable over time.

## What is CodeHealth™?

CodeHealth is a code quality metric that aligns with how engineers perceive maintainability. Peer-reviewed research shows that higher CodeHealth is associated with outcomes that matter for software-intensive organizations.
- **Healthy code** is associated with, on average, **15× fewer defects**, **2× faster feature implementation**, and **10× lower uncertainty in task completion**  
  ([TechDebt 2022, arXiv preprint])
- **CodeHealth provides a shared language** for discussing the business impact of code quality with executive stakeholders  
  🏆 *Best Paper Award*  ([TechDebt 2024, arXiv preprint])
- **CodeHealth outperforms established alternatives**, performing **6× better than SonarQube’s metric** on a public benchmark and outperforming the traditional **Maintainability Index**  
  ([ICSME 2024, arXiv preprint])
