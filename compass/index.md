**Thesis:** Healthy code has never been more important than in the AI era. First, healthy code is more AI-friendly. Second, as the volume of code increases, we must make it easy for humans to read - in the foreseeable future, this will still be needed. CodeHealth can act as a compass for humans and code alike to ensure the code is maintainable.

## What is CodeHealth™?

CodeHealth is a code quality metric that aligns with how engineers perceive maintainability. Peer-reviewed research shows that higher CodeHealth is associated with outcomes that matter for software-intensive organizations.
- **Healthy code** is associated with, on average, **15× fewer defects**, **2× faster feature implementation**, and **10× lower uncertainty in task completion**  
  ([TechDebt 2022, arXiv preprint])
- **CodeHealth provides a shared language** for discussing the business impact of code quality with executive stakeholders  
  🏆 *Best Paper Award, TechDebt 2024*  
  ([TechDebt 2024, arXiv preprint])
- **CodeHealth outperforms established alternatives**, performing **6× better than SonarQube’s metric** on a public benchmark and outperforming the traditional **Maintainability Index**
